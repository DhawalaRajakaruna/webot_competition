# Wall-Following Algorithm for ePuck Robot 🏎️  

We worked on this repo to participate in the **IESL RoboGames 2024**. This repository contains all the **practiced codes** along with a simple **wall-following algorithm** implemented in **Webots**, designed to navigate through a maze while identifying five specific colors. The **ePuck robot** pauses in front of each detected color in a predefined order.

## 📌 Features  
✅ Wall-following algorithm for maze navigation 🏁  
✅ Color identification system 🎨  
✅ ePuck robot pauses at detected colors  
✅ Implemented in **Webots**  
✅ Contains all practiced codes  

## 🎨 Color Detection Order  
The ePuck robot detects and waits in front of colors in the following sequence:  
1. 🔴 **Red**  
2. 🟡 **Yellow**  
3. 💖 **Pink**  
4. 🤎 **Brown**  
5. 💚 **Green**  

The task takes some time to complete as the robot methodically navigates through the maze.
